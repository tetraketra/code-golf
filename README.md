### **Alternesting**
Given an input, wrap in parens then go in one character on each side and repeat for brackets. Repeat until you reach the string's core (len <= 2). 
`Hello World!` becomes `(H[e(l[l(o[ W]o)r]l)d]!)

### **Print Own Size**
Prints a script's file's byte count.

---

### **RandInt Until Zero**
Print random integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive).
Stop *after* printing any 0.

---

### **Switch Case Tuple**
Given a switch case in a nested tuple format `((condition_code_as_str, result), (condition_code_as_str_two, result_two), ...)`, return the result for the first true condition.

---

### **Dial-Up**
Phone number pads associate certain letters with certain numbers. Either encode (e.g. "Hi!" > "44!") or decode (e.g. "44!" > "Hi!"|"IG!") along these lines.
This is accomplished in a dumb way for brevity. See [tetraketra/dial-up](https://github.com/tetraketra/dial-up) for a slightly less dumb version.

---

### **N-Body**
Perform massive n-body position updating.

--- 

### **2048**
Recreate the game [2048](https://play2048.co/).

---

### Reverse Polish Notation
Treat a single line of user input as simply reverse polish ntoation and print the resultant calculated value.

---

### Smallest Ascii Total
Define a function which accepts a list of strings and returns with the highest "ascii total".
"ascii total" is calculated by converting each character in a string to its ascii integer value, then summing the resultant numbers.

---

### First Condition
Evaluate an arbitrary list of tuples of boolean conditions (as code strings) and values (as any), returning the associated value for the first true condition.
